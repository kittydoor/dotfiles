# Subpath ingress
## https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/1583
kubectl port-forward deployment/prometheus-server 9090:9090

## Command below doesn't work
kubectl proxy
http://localhost:8001/api/v1/namespaces/default/services/prometheus-server:80/proxy/graph

## Using ingress subpath and rewrite doesn't work either, see issue above

# Namespaces

## Currently must manually create namespaces
